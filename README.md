# Boom - ASCII art

This repo contains code (my own implementations) for a project from the Udemy course "The Modern Python 3 Bootcamp", which is the course that brought Python to my life and enabled me to start utilising it personally and professionally for data analysis and process automation (among others)!

The file __ascii_art.py__ generates a simple ASCII art printer (using the `pyfiglet` module) that asks for a message to be printed and for the colour of the text and its background.

How to run:

   - Install the `pyfiglet` module [(pypi link)](https://pypi.org/project/pyfiglet/0.7/).
   - Install the `termcolor` module [(pypi link)](https://pypi.org/project/termcolor/).
   - __For Windows Powershell__ install the `Colorama` module as well [(pypi link)](https://pypi.org/project/colorama/), as the `termcolor` module        does not work in Powershell by default (this will also result in a coloured text output in Powershell).
